# Tier 3 Task 1:

# Automated System Installation Script

Here’s how I created an automated installation script (install.sh) for CentOS 8 to handle tasks like partitioning the disk, installing packages, creating users, and configuring the system. Below is the breakdown of the script, and I’ve documented each step as I implemented it. You can modify and extend this script as needed for your specific use cases.

# 1. install.sh Overview
The script will:
Partition the disk using parted.
Format partitions (e.g., ext4 or XFS).
Install required packages via yum.
Configure networking settings.
Create user accounts and set passwords.
Customize system settings (hostname, timezone, etc.).
Perform post-installation tasks like setting up a firewall and SSH access.

# Explanation of Key Sections


# 1. Partitioning the Disk

<img width="346" alt="p2 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/419dc8f5-dfa7-42cf-882e-dc18ee111367">


In this part of the script, the disk is being prepared for use by mounting two partitions: one for the root file system (/) and one for the boot directory (/boot). These partitions have already been created earlier in the script using the parted command, which defined the disk partitions (such as a boot partition and a root partition) and formatted them with the ext4 file system, though other file systems like XFS could be used as well.
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:


Mounting the Partitions:

The script first echoes the message "Mounting partitions..." to the terminal and appends it to the log file ($LOGFILE) to track progress. This step helps with logging and keeping a record of the operations being performed.


Mounting the Root Partition:

The root partition, which is stored as the second partition ("${DISK}2"), is mounted to /mnt. This assumes that the variable ${DISK} contains the path to the target disk (e.g., /dev/sda), and the 2 refers to the second partition. Mounting it to /mnt means that this location will temporarily serve as the root directory during the installation or setup process.


Creating and Mounting the Boot Partition: 

Next, the script creates a boot directory within /mnt by running mkdir -p /mnt/boot. The -p flag ensures that the directory is created if it doesn’t already exist, and any necessary parent directories are also created. The first partition ("${DISK}1") is then mounted to /mnt/boot, which is the standard location for storing the bootloader and related files. The boot partition contains essential files that are needed during the boot process, such as the kernel and the initial RAM disk.


This method ensures that the root and boot partitions are correctly mounted so that the system can be set up properly. During an installation process, files will be copied to these partitions (e.g., system files to /mnt and bootloader files to /mnt/boot). If additional partitions, such as a home or swap partition, were part of the setup, they would also be mounted in a similar way at this stage.


After this part of the script is executed, the following system configurations are applied:


<img width="447" alt="p2 9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe4a77e1-cc98-4661-8cbc-c393cfa3528e">



# 2. Package Installation

<img width="378" alt="p2 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b38c8ac-b0ec-4f10-923b-1f8d2255a7de">


yum is used to install common packages such as vim, net-tools, firewalld, and openssh-server. You can modify the package list based on your needs.


<img width="462" alt="p2 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d2f4a8-d842-43c1-a512-4efa7daf0caa">



# 3. Network Configuration

<img width="434" alt="p2 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3cdf71f-c499-4f78-8efe-e6b6088da833">



This section of the script is responsible for configuring the network settings of a CentOS system by customizing the network interface for static IP assignment. First, it defines key variables: NETWORK_INTERFACE specifies the interface being configured (in this case, eth0), while IP_ADDRESS, NETMASK, GATEWAY, and DNS provide the specific details for the static IP configuration.


The script begins by echoing a message ("Configuring network settings...") to inform the user that network configuration is in progress. This message is also appended to a log file ($LOGFILE) for record-keeping. It then generates a network configuration file (/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0) using a "here document" (the cat <<EOT syntax). This configuration file defines the following key parameters:


TYPE=Ethernet:

Specifies the network interface type as Ethernet.
BOOTPROTO=static: Indicates that the network will use a static IP configuration.


NAME and DEVICE:

Both set the network interface to eth0.
ONBOOT=yes: Ensures the interface is enabled automatically at boot.
IPADDR, NETMASK, GATEWAY, and DNS1: Assign the static IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server, respectively.
Once the file is created with these settings, the script restarts the NetworkManager service using systemctl restart NetworkManager. This action applies the new configuration, bringing the interface up with the specified static IP settings. If this were to be adapted for DHCP instead of static, the BOOTPROTO=static line would simply be replaced with BOOTPROTO=dhcp, and the other specific IP configuration parameters would be omitted.


# 4. User Creation

<img width="339" alt="p2 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f99a0390-d675-40f5-98a4-e47d0900f06d">


For Loop:
The loop iterates over the usernames array using the for i in "${!usernames[@]}" construct, which gets both the index and the value of each element.

username=${usernames[$i]}: This assigns the current username from the array.

password=${passwords[$i]}: This assigns the corresponding password from the passwords array.

User Existence Check:


id "$username" &>/dev/null: The id command checks if the user already exists. If they do, the script skips that user.


User Creation:

useradd "$username": This creates a new user account with the given username. The home directory is created automatically unless otherwise specified.


Password Assignment:

echo "$username:$password" | chpasswd: This sets the password for the user. The chpasswd command is used to set passwords for multiple users at once. Here, the password is echoed and piped into chpasswd.


Password Expiration:

passwd --expire "$username": This forces the user to change their password upon their first login.


Feedback:

After the user is created and the password is set, the script prints a message to the console for each user.

# 5. System Customization

<img width="349" alt="Capture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3102add-fbfa-4d7e-a330-f59725630e0a">



In this section of the script, system settings such as the hostname, timezone, and language/keyboard layout are configured to match the desired environment. The hostnamectl command is used to set the system's hostname to "myserver," which identifies the machine on the network. The timedatectl command sets the system's timezone to "America/New_York," ensuring that the system clock displays the correct local time. Finally, the localectl command is used to set the system's locale to "en_US.UTF-8," which configures the system to use English language settings, and the keyboard layout is set to "us" for the U.S. keyboard layout. Adjust these settings as needed to fit your specific requirements.

# Post-Installation Tasks

<img width="343" alt="p2 7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89981f0d-bd6c-4dae-9100-a1eb6c1b9172">



This part of the script focuses on post-installation tasks related to securing the system through the firewall and enabling remote access via SSH. It automates the process of configuring the firewall and ensuring that the system is ready for remote management.


Configuring the Firewall:

The script begins by echoing the message "Configuring firewall..." to the terminal and appending it to the log file ($LOGFILE). This step provides real-time feedback and keeps a record of the firewall configuration for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.


Enabling and Starting Firewalld:

The script enables the firewalld service using the command systemctl enable firewalld. This ensures that the firewall service will automatically start on boot, maintaining the security settings persistently across reboots. Next, the script starts the firewalld service with systemctl start firewalld, which activates the firewall immediately, enforcing the default or custom security rules defined by the user.


Allowing SSH Access:

To permit secure remote access to the server, the script runs firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh. This command permanently adds SSH (Secure Shell) to the firewall's allowed services. By doing so, it ensures that incoming SSH traffic is allowed through the firewall, making it possible for administrators or users to remotely access the system via an encrypted SSH connection.


Allowing HTTP Access:

Similarly, the script allows HTTP traffic by running firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http. This command opens up port 80, which is commonly used for web servers, enabling external access to any web services hosted on the system.


<img width="292" alt="p2 11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ffc3476-8ff8-4a47-bc59-18bee1e0c45e">


Reloading the Firewall: 

The final step in this section is reloading the firewall rules using firewall-cmd --reload. This command applies the changes made (allowing SSH and HTTP traffic) without needing to restart the firewall service. The --permanent flag ensures that these rules persist across reboots.


Together, these commands configure the firewall to protect the system while allowing essential services like SSH and HTTP access. This is a critical step in securing the server after installation and ensuring that it can be managed remotely while permitting web traffic.


# 7. System Customization

<img width="446" alt="p1 9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0816b587-2936-438d-ba24-09846919a120">


   
In this final part of the script, titled "Completion and Final Checks," the script wraps up the installation process and reboots the system to apply all the configurations and changes made during the process.


Echoing the Completion Message: 

The script first outputs a message saying, "Installation complete. Rebooting the system..." to both the terminal and the log file ($LOGFILE). This serves as a final indication to the user or administrator that the installation tasks are successfully completed and the system is ready to be rebooted. This message in the log file can also help track when the installation was finalized.


# Rebooting the System:

The command reboot is used to restart the system. This is crucial because several configuration changes (such as kernel updates, network settings, and partition mounting) often require a reboot to take full effect. By including this command at the end of the script, the system automatically reboots without requiring manual intervention.


Once rebooted, the system will boot with all the new configurations, firewall rules, network settings, and partition changes fully applied, completing the entire setup process. This approach ensures that everything works as expected after the reboot, particularly when new kernels or system-level changes are involved.

# Testing and Compatibility

Ensure the script is executable by running the following command:

chmod +x install.sh


Run the script as root or with sudo:

sudo ./install.sh


Test the script on multiple systems and validate that it works consistently. Make adjustments based on any specific configurations or hardware variations.


# Documentation and Troubleshooting


Log File: 

The script logs its progress to /var/log/install_script.log. You can review this file to troubleshoot any issues that arise during installation.


<img width="333" alt="p2 12L" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4aacb07-4c08-4e55-9bc9-f1074d4e6772">


Error Handling: The script uses set -e to ensure that it exits immediately if any command fails.

# Conclusion and Key Takeaways

Creating an automated installation script like install.sh has been a valuable exercise in streamlining system setup and configuration. Here are some key takeaways and conclusions from this process:

1. Automating System Setup

By automating tasks such as disk partitioning, package installation, and user creation, I’ve significantly reduced the time and effort required to set up new systems. Automation ensures that each system is configured consistently, minimizing human error and improving reliability.

2. Disk Partitioning and Formatting

The script demonstrates the use of parted for disk partitioning and mkfs.ext4 for formatting. This approach ensures that the disk is prepared correctly for the installation process, and automating this step reduces the risk of manual errors.

# Tier 3 Task 2: Implementing Disk Encryption for Data Security

# Steps to Implement Disk Encryption with LUKS
# 1. Identify Partitions or Volumes

List Partitions and Volumes:

I started by listing all available block devices using the lsblk command. This showed me the partitions and their mount points, helping me understand the current partition layout and usage.

lsblk

Check Disk Usage: Next, I used df -h to see which partitions are used for data storage and to get an overview of disk usage. This step was crucial to identify sensitive data and decide which partitions required encryption.

df -h


<img width="323" alt="p3 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d179ba8-72b2-45e4-bc87-a4b85fede8ae">


Review Partition Layout:

For more detailed information about partition tables, I used fdisk -l. This provided a comprehensive view of the partition scheme and helped me verify the layout.

sudo fdisk -l

# 2. Optional: Move Existing Data

Create a Temporary Mount Point: 

If /home already had data, I created a temporary mount point to safely move the data before encryption.

sudo mkdir /mnt/temp_home

Mount the Current /home: I mounted the existing /home directory to the temporary location.

sudo mount --bind /home /mnt/temp_home

Copy Data to a New Location: If needed, I copied the data to a new location to ensure it was preserved during the encryption process.

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backup

sudo cp -a /mnt/temp_home/* /mnt/backup/

# 3. Mount the New Partition

Create the Mount Point:

I created a mount point for the new partition where it would be mounted after encryption.

sudo mkdir /home

Mount the New Partition: I mounted the new partition to /home.

sudo mount /dev/sdc2 /home

# 4. Update /etc/fstab

Edit /etc/fstab: To ensure that the new partition mounts automatically at boot, I edited the /etc/fstab file and added an entry for /dev/sdc2.

sudo nano /etc/fstab

I added the following line:

/dev/sdc2  /home  ext4  defaults  0  2

This change makes sure the system mounts the partition correctly on startup.

# 5. Install Encryption Tools

Install cryptsetup: 

I installed the cryptsetup package, which provides the tools needed for managing LUKS encryption.

sudo yum install cryptsetup



<img width="450" alt="p3 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4f4b7e-768d-4162-84e3-a1b4967962a1">



# 6. Backup Important Data

Backup Data:

Before proceeding with encryption, I made sure to back up all important data on the partitions to be encrypted. This step was crucial to prevent data loss if anything went wrong during the encryption process.

# 7. Create an Encrypted Container

Initialize LUKS Encryption:

I formatted the partition with LUKS encryption using the cryptsetup luksFormat command. This step sets up the encryption and requires me to enter and confirm a passphrase, which is needed to unlock the partition.

sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdc2


<img width="450" alt="p3 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294841d3-b502-43f6-a7a9-80b5d22c8a63">


Open the Encrypted Container: I then opened the encrypted container, making it available for mounting.

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc2 my_encrypted_volume

# 8. Format the Encrypted Container

Format the Encrypted Container:

I formatted the newly opened encrypted volume with the ext4 filesystem.

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume


<img width="424" alt="p3 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16a48980-0736-49f7-942d-1a2f1654b4f6">


# 9. Mount the Encrypted Container

Create a Mount Point: 

I created a mount point for the encrypted container.

sudo mkdir /mnt/my_encrypted_data

Mount the Filesystem: 

I then mounted the encrypted container to the newly created mount point.

sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /mnt/my_encrypted_data

# 10. Update /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab

Edit /etc/crypttab:

To automate the unlocking of the encrypted volume at boot, I added an entry for the encrypted volume in the /etc/crypttab file.

sudo vi /etc/crypttab

I added the following line:

my_encrypted_volume /dev/sdc2 none luks

Edit /etc/fstab:

I also updated /etc/fstab to ensure the encrypted volume is mounted automatically at boot.

sudo vi /etc/fstab

I added the following line:

/dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /mnt/my_encrypted_data ext4 defaults 0 2



<img width="449" alt="p3 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0958a873-7207-42ed-8893-e43ab7faea7f">



# 11. Test the Encryption Setup

Reboot the Server:

I rebooted the server to verify that the encrypted volumes are properly mounted and accessible.

sudo reboot

Verify Mount Points: 

After rebooting, I checked if the encrypted volumes were mounted correctly.

df -h | grep /mnt/my_encrypted_data

Test Accessibility:

I created and read files to ensure that the encrypted volume was writable and readable.

sudo touch /mnt/my_encrypted_data/testfile

sudo ls -l /mnt/my_encrypted_data

sudo cat /mnt/my_encrypted_data/testfile

# 12. Implement Secure Management of Encryption Keys

Use a Hardware Security Module (HSM): 

I configured an HSM to securely store encryption keys and followed the manufacturer's guidelines for integration.

Use a Key Management Service (KMS):

I considered cloud-based KMS solutions like AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud KMS, and followed their documentation for integration.

Secure Offline Storage: 

If using offline storage, I ensured that keys were stored in a secure physical location and access was restricted.

Key Rotation and Management:

I implemented key rotation policies to periodically change encryption keys and documented key access and usage policies.
Monitor System Performance and Resource Utilization

# 13. Monitor Performance Metrics: I used tools like top, iostat, and vmstat to monitor system performance and ensure encryption did not cause excessive latency.

top
iostat -x
vmstat 1

Assess Resource Utilization: 

I checked CPU and memory usage to ensure they were within acceptable ranges, considering that encryption might slightly increase CPU usage.

free -m

Performance Benchmarks: 

I conducted performance benchmarks to compare system performance before and after encryption, analyzing results to identify and address any significant impacts.

# By following these detailed steps, I successfully implemented disk encryption with LUKS on my CentOS server, enhancing data security while maintaining system functionality and performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tier 3 Task 3: Automated Configuration Management with Ansible

# Implementing Automated Configuration Management with Ansible

Implementing automated configuration management with Ansible involves several steps, from setting up the control node to managing and testing playbooks. Here's my step-by-step guide to help me complete **Tier 3 Task 3**.

## 1. Set Up an Ansible Control Node

### Install Ansible:
On my control node (which can be any system I choose to manage other systems), I install Ansible using the package manager.  
For a CentOS/RHEL system, I use:

```bash
sudo yum install ansible

For Ubuntu/Debian systems, I use:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible

Verify Installation:

Ensure Ansible is installed correctly by checking its version:

ansible --version

2. Define Inventory Files

Create Inventory File:

Ansible uses an inventory file to list and group hosts. The default location is /etc/ansible/hosts, but I can specify a different file with the -i option.
I create or edit an inventory file, e.g., inventory.ini:

[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[databases]
db1.example.com

I can also define variables specific to each group or host.

Test Connectivity:

Verify that Ansible can connect to my hosts:

ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini

3. Create Ansible Playbooks

Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define the tasks to be executed. Here’s a brief overview of how I create playbooks for various tasks:

Install Packages:

Create a playbook install_packages.yml:

- name: Install packages
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install HTTPD
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Install Git
      yum:
        name: git
        state: present

Manage Services:

Create a playbook manage_services.yml:

- name: Manage services
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure HTTPD is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Stop and disable firewalld
      service:
        name: firewalld
        state: stopped
        enabled: no

Configure System Settings:

Create a playbook configure_system.yml:

- name: Configure system settings
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a new user
      user:
        name: newuser
        state: present
        groups: wheel
        shell: /bin/bash

    - name: Configure timezone
      timezone:
        name: America/New_York

Manage Configuration Files:

Create a playbook manage_files.yml:

- name: Manage configuration files
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Copy custom configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/configfile
        dest: /etc/custom/configfile
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'

4. Test Ansible Playbooks

Run Playbooks:

Execute each playbook to ensure they work correctly:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_packages.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini manage_services.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini configure_system.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini manage_files.yml

Verify Changes:

Log in to my managed hosts to verify that the changes were applied correctly. For example, I check that services are running, packages are installed, and configuration files are updated.

5. Implement Version Control

Initialize Git Repository:

Navigate to the directory where I store my playbooks:

cd /path/to/your/playbooks
git init

Add and Commit Playbooks:

Add my playbooks to the repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Ansible playbooks"

Push to Remote Repository (Optional):

If I have a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), I push my changes:

git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin master

6. Schedule Automated Playbook Runs

Using Ansible Tower (AWX):

Ansible Tower (or AWX, its open-source counterpart) provides a web interface for scheduling playbook runs. I can create jobs and set schedules for these jobs through the Tower interface.

Using Cron Jobs:

If I don’t have Ansible Tower, I can use cron jobs to schedule playbook runs. For example, to run a playbook daily at midnight:

sudo crontab -e

Add the following line:

0 0 * * * ansible-playbook -i /path/to/inventory.ini /path/to/playbook.yml

7. Monitor and Audit Changes

Enable Ansible Logging:

Configure Ansible to log its activities. I set the logging configuration in the ansible.cfg file:

[defaults]
log_path = /var/log/ansible.log

Review Logs:

Periodically review the logs to ensure that playbooks are running as expected and no errors are occurring.

Audit Changes:

Use tools like auditd or OSSEC to monitor and audit changes made to my system. These tools help track configuration changes and detect unauthorized modifications.

8. Document the Configuration Management Process

Create Documentation:

I document my Ansible setup, including:

	•	Playbook Structure: Describe the purpose of each playbook and its tasks.
	•	Usage Instructions: Provide instructions on how to run and manage playbooks.
	•	Best Practices: Include recommendations for writing and maintaining playbooks, such as using roles and including comments.

Share Documentation:

I share my documentation with my team or store it in a centralized location where others can access it.

By following these steps, I can set up automated configuration management with Ansible, ensuring consistent and efficient system management across multiple hosts.

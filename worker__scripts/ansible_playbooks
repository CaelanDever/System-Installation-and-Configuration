Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define the tasks to be executed. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how I create playbooks for various tasks:

Install Packages:

Create a playbook install_packages.yml:

- name: Install packages
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install HTTPD
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Install Git
      yum:
        name: git
        state: present

Manage Services:

Create a playbook manage_services.yml:

- name: Manage services
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure HTTPD is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Stop and disable firewalld
      service:
        name: firewalld
        state: stopped
        enabled: no

Configure System Settings:

Create a playbook configure_system.yml:

- name: Configure system settings
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a new user
      user:
        name: newuser
        state: present
        groups: wheel
        shell: /bin/bash

    - name: Configure timezone
      timezone:
        name: America/New_York

Manage Configuration Files:

Create a playbook manage_files.yml:

- name: Manage configuration files
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Copy custom configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/configfile
        dest: /etc/custom/configfile
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
